# project-setup
Bunch of instructions so I dont have to google each time I start a project.

### Initialize a project with npm.
Run `npm init` this will ask bunch of questions.  
Run `npm init -y` to skip all questions.  
More about the command [Here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init).
